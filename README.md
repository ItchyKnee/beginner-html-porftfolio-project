This is a very basic portfolio website I created using only **HTML**. The project is part of my journey into web development, and I followed Dr. Angela Yu's "Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp to learn the very basics of HTML.

## Project Overview

This portfolio includes:

- A **Home Page** with a brief introduction about myself.
